Initial setup for VGFL  (Virtual Game Framework Library)

This library can be used to create games that are played through a mobile app (HTML5 website?).

The game consists of a bit of javascript defining the game. It must be uploaded to a game-server,
which in turn will run the game. Users can log into the game, and play it.
